# Spreading of Water Waves
(Bachelor's final project)

In this project, I will investigate the spreading problem of water waves and obtain a mathematical description in 
two-dimensional and three dimensional spaces which is involved with the classical Cauchy-Poisson problem in 19th century. 
In the first half part, I will mainly discuss the two-dimensional problem including how the mathemat- ical model extracted 
from our real life which may refer to the derivation of governing equation and initial and boundary conditions, and use Maple 
to process the numerical calculation. Three-dimensional spreading problem will be studied in the rest of my dissertation.
Basically, compared with two-dimensional problem, three-dimensional case will do the same work but in three-dimensional space. 
In the very last part, I will draw a conclusion about almost everything that has been achieved in my work.
