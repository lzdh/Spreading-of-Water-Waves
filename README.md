# Spreading of Water Waves
(Bachelor's final project)

In this project, I investigated the spreading problem of water waves and obtained a mathematical description in 
two-dimensional and three dimensional spaces which is involved with the classical Cauchy-Poisson problem in 19th century. 
In the first half part, I mainly discussed the two-dimensional problem including how the mathematical model extracted 
from our real life which may refer to the derivation of governing equation and initial and boundary conditions, and used Maple 
to process the numerical calculation. Three-dimensional spreading problem were studied in the rest of the project.
Comparing with the two-dimensional problem, three-dimensional case are almost the same but in three-dimensional space.
